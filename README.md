### Project Title
Bikeshare project

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, 
New York City, and Washington. A code was used to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Lastly, a script that 
was used to take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
